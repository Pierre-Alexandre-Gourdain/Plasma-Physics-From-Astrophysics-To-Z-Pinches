# Plasma-Physics-From-Astrophysics-To-Z-Pinches
*Learning plasma physics via computer simulations*

This book is intended to teach plasma physics to undergradaute and graduate students using computer simulations. Based on gaining intuition rather than specialized knowledge, this course uses python to explore *simple* models, that will help students establihing solid foundations in plasma physics. Throughout the book, the approach will remains basic, both in science and computational complexity.
